# -EDA-of-Cancer-Survival-Dataset
The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the
University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Objective of the problem is to find whether a new pateint who has undergone surgery for breast cancer
will survive 5 years or longer
or
die within 5 years after the surgery.

It is basically a supervised bi-classification problem hence we have two labels in our taget variable (Survival status) i.e.,
1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer
2 = the patient died within 5 year

For the purpose of classifiaction we make use of three features namely :
age (Age of patient at time of operation (numerical))
operation_Year (Patients year of operation (year - 1900, numerical))
axil_nodes (Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical))
